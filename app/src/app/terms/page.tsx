    <li><strong>Provision of Services</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><u>Move Registry</u>. The Move Registry is a blockchain-based registration system designed to enable developers to reference Move packages using easily identifiable names instead of cryptographic addresses, simplifying development and enhancing cross-network interoperability. The Move Registry allows users to register their Move packages with human-readable names ending in ‚Äú.move‚Äù (‚Äú<u>Human Readable Names</u>‚Äù) and associate them with existing ‚Äú.sui‚Äù names registered with the Sui Name Service protocol (the ‚Äú<u>SuiNS Protocol</u>‚Äù). Users may use the Services to access and interact with the Move Registry, including to register, search, and manage the Move Registry and their associated Move package addresses. </li>
            <li><u>SuiNS Protocol</u>. Although the Move Registry utilizes the SuiNS Protocol and its underlying decentralized Sui blockchain network, neither the Foundation nor its associated entities provide, own, or control the SuiNS Protocol, which is entirely run by smart contracts deployed on the Sui blockchain. Upgrades and modifications to the SuiNS Protocol are determined by its community‚Äôs self-governance processes, as may be in effect from time to time. We disclaim any liability for any issues arising from the use or operation of the Sui blockchain or the SuiNS Protocol, including but not limited to delays, losses, malfunctions, or other damages. </li>
            <li><u>Move Package Registration</u>. Users using the Move Registry are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the SuiNS Protocol name, Human Readable Names and Move package information that they provide. Any information submitted to the Registry and recorded on the blockchain is immutable upon registration and may not be modified. In addition, you are solely responsible for uploading, providing and maintaining the availability, security and useability of any Move packages. Neither the Foundation nor any third parties shall be responsible for the availability, useability, security or content associated with any Move packages that you use in connection with the Move Registry.</li>
            <li><u>Registration and Renewal of SuiNS Protocol Names</u>. While Human Readable Names recorded on the blockchain are immutable and do not expire, names registered on the SuiNS Protocol require registration, maintenance and periodic renewals, and it is solely your responsibility to monitor and renew your registrations. If a SuiNS Protocol name expires, the name may become available for registration by other users, potentially resulting in the loss of the link between your SuiNS Protocol name and any associated Move packages. It is solely your responsibility to ensure timely renewal, maintenance and security of your SuiNS Protocol names to prevent the potential loss of ownership or link disruption to the Move Registry. IN THE EVENT THAT YOU FAIL TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN, RENEW OR SECURE REGISTRATION OF YOUR SUINS PROTOCOL NAMES, YOU AND ANY THIRD PARTIES OR SOFTWARE PROTOCOLS INTERACTING WITH YOUR SUINS PROTOCOL NAMES, MOVE PACKAGES, OR THE MOVE REGISTRY, MAY IRRETRIEVABLY LOSE THE ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH, REGISTER, UPDATE, RETRIEVE AND USE THE MOVE REGISTRY AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN. The Foundation and its associated entities cannot forcibly remove, prevent, renew, or interfere with the ability of any person to register a name on the SuiNS Protocol's registry once it has expired. As a result, the Foundation disclaims any liability for your inability to use, register, or renew any name on the SuiNS Protocol or the associated consequences to the Move Registry resulting thereof. You agree not to hold the Foundation liable for any claims, damages, or losses associated with the expiration of a SuiNS Protocol name, including the loss of any link between a Move package and your SuiNS Protocol name. </li>
            <li><u>Non-Custodial Nature</u>.The Website is a non-custodial application, meaning you are solely responsible for the custody of your cryptographic private keys to the digital asset wallets you hold, as well as the instructions and transactions that you engage in using your cryptographic private keys and digital asset wallets. These Terms do not create or impose any duties on the Foundation. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that the Foundation owes no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that any such duties or liabilities that may exist at law or in equity are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and foregone. The only duties and obligations owed to you by the Foundation are those explicitly set out in these Terms.</li>
            <li><u>Wallet Security</u>. Users are encouraged to use hardware wallets or other secure methods to manage their cryptographic keys, including in connection with Move Registry registrations. You are solely responsible for ensuring the security of your wallet and private keys. If you lose access to your wallet or your keys are compromised, the Foundation cannot recover your assets or associated Move Registry registrations. It is recommended that you regularly back up your private keys in a secure environment and avoid sharing sensitive information related to wallet access.</li>
            <li><u>Service Fees</u>. In addition to blockchain gas fees, users may incur fees for interacting with the Move Registry, such as to register Move packages. From time to time, the Foundation may charge fees for utilizing the Services, and users are responsible for reviewing the latest fee structure before engaging in transactions.</li>
            <li><u>Variable Costs and Transaction Speeds</u>. You will be required to pay any and all fees associated with using the Move Registry, including gas and transaction fees. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, including the Sui blockchain and the SuiNS Protocol, are variable and may fluctuate dramatically. The Foundation is not responsible for any increased costs or delays associated with your transactions on the SuiNS Protocol.</li>
            <li><u>Non-Refundability</u>. Once a Move package is associated with a SuiNS Protocol name via the Move Registry, the related gas fees and any other related fees are non-refundable. All transactions executed by the Services on the blockchain are final and irreversible. </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
